# FileSyncToy - A modern SyncToy with a nod to the past.

A new Windows 10/11 file sync tool. If you have any requirements, suggestions, must have's, or want to ask about this project - use the Github Issues - thanks.

See the Wiki page for more information. We're going through the old forums looking at suggestions and bugs in the original, and merging thise into this devopment.

# Design Principles

If you've never seen SyncToy, go have a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncToy).

* Styling and color schemes of the original, making it familiar for anyone who has used SyncToy.
  
* A rewrite of the .Net Sync Framework with improvements and bug fixes. So far we have increased performance for enumeration beyond the expections of SyncToy; what took the original hours to complete, now takes a few minutes - for very large jobs.
  
* Native Windows development using C#, .Net 7, and WinUI for Desktop.

# Progress

We're in active development...
* :white_check_mark: [February 2023] Core design layout completed. 
* :white_check_mark: [March 2023] File filters and enumeration complete
* :small_orange_diamond: [Current Task] Preview (80% complete) and "Actions" (90% complete)

# Roadmap

The first release will provide most of the functionality of the original and be the ground zero for future enhancements. The focus is to get a working SyncToy alternative to satisfy most people and then take requests for changes and enhancements; we also have a list the length of a CVS receipt of things planned - the priorities will change based on feedback.
