# FileSyncToy - A modern SyncToy with a nod to the past.

A new Windows 10/11 file sync tool. If you have any requirements, suggestions, must have's, or want to ask about this project - use the Github Issues - thanks.

See the Wiki page for more information.

# Design Principles

If you've never seen SyncToy, go have a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncToy).

* Styling and color schemes of the original, making it familiar for anyone who has used SyncToy.
  
* A rewrite of the .Net Sync Framework with improvements and bug fixes. So far we have increased performance for enumeration beyond the expections of SyncToy; what took the original hours to complete, now takes a few minutes - for very large jobs.
  
* Native Windows development using C#, .Net 7, and WinUI for Desktop.
